When designing TFT LCD displays for embedded systems, customizing the FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) layout is often necessary for mechanical compatibility, pinout optimization, and EMI reduction.

## Why Custom FPC Layout Matters

Most standard TFT modules come with a default FPC shape and pin sequence. However, in real-world product design:

- Your enclosure might require the FPC to bend or exit from a specific direction
- You might need the pin order to match your mainboard directly
- Clearance may be needed for mechanical standoffs or nearby components

## Key Parameters

Here are some FPC customization options you can define:

- **Length and width**: Matches enclosure space
- **Bend line position**: Aligns with hinge or outlet
- **Connector pitch**: 0.5mm, 0.3mm, or custom
- **Reinforcement area**: For stiffening and solder reliability
- **ICs or passive parts on FPC**: Optional pull-ups, decoupling caps, etc.

## Integration Tips

When preparing for mass production:

1. Use Gerber files to define mechanical outline
2. Work closely with display module vendor for stack-up and DRC
3. Validate samples with actual mainboard mating
