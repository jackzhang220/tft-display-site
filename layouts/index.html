<h1>Welcome to the TFT Display Technology Blog</h1>
  <p>
    This site is dedicated to exploring the science, engineering, and integration of 
    <strong>TFT LCD displays</strong> across a wide range of embedded applications. 
    From foundational display knowledge 
    (<a href="/posts/what-is-tft-lcd/">What is TFT LCD</a>) <!-- 内链1 -->
    to advanced interface and bonding techniques, 
    our goal is to help developers, engineers, and product teams make informed decisions 
    when selecting and implementing display modules.
  </p>

  <h2>What You’ll Find Here:</h2>
